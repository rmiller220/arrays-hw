## How confident do you feel with the conent on Arrays so far?
I feel ok about arrays. I feel like there are a ton of different commands that all take special attention to complete them correctly. I feel like I understand how to create them, but I do not feel confident about adjusting them. 

## Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
Not really. I think I just need more practice to make myself more familiar and comfortable with everything. 

## What questions do you have about Arrays?

I do not have a specific question. I think I just need to spend more time with them. Watching others do it and practice myself. I really like to do my work with another person watching because I dont have the confidence in what I am doing all the time.
